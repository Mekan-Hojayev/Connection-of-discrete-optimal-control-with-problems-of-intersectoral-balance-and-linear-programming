Connection of discrete optimal control with problems of intersectoral balance and linear programming
The economy is broken down into separate production units - a pure industry. It is believed that one net article produces only one product, different industries produce different products. We single out pure individuals and number them and their products.
Leontiev observed the time series of the output of industries:
- gross output of the i-th industry in the period of time t.

- the amount of products of the i-th industry, which is used as raw materials by the j-th   
   industry in the period of time t.

Leontiev analyzed the behavior of the sequence

- ratio weakly depends on time   =>

- can be considered constants

- Leontief direct cost matrix

- final output of the i-th industry in the time period t
